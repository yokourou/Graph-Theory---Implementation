## Contents

The project includes implementations of the following algorithms:

- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Shortest Path Finding (Dijkstra)
- Kruskal's Algorithm for Minimum Spanning Tree
- Tarjan's Algorithm for Strongly Connected Components (SCC)
- Max Flow Algorithm (Ford-Fulkerson)
- Graph Coloring Algorithm (Welsh-Powell)

Each algorithm is accompanied by its Python implementation and a usage example.
